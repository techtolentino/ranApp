	    <p>The first thing you should know is that I'm truly blessed and lucky to be where I am today. To put it simply - I have a beautiful family that I am completely in love with. I have an amazing career as a Software Product Design Professional at IBM. And, there is a certain type of momentum I see in myself that I have never seen before.</p>

	    <p>The truth be told, it hasn't always been this way. In fact, we once lived in a small, crammed bedroom in a relative's house in San Diego, California. I worked for the YMCA, making about $15 an hour, and expected to support a family of four. Hope of a promising future was dim.</p>

	    <p>In December of 2013, I remember failing a Skype interview for an Ed-Tech position in Portland, OR. The interviewer proposed the scenario of a teacher wanting to make the switch from 'using Dreamweaver to writing her own CSS', then asked me what my recommendation would be.</p>

			<p>That initial failure hurt, honestly, but it inspired me to bounce back and pick up the skills I lacked. The feeling that I failed my family bothered so much that I made the decision to learn to code. I soon discovered a strong interest in various programming languages and found an obsession with problem solving, as cliche as that may sound. After hearing this, my wife's friend (Peter Tubig) gave us the suggestion of having me look into a 'developer bootcamp'.</p>

<!-- 			<h3 class="light quote"><em>"What the hell is that?"</em><br><span class="small-caption">-me, again</span></h3> -->

			<p>Less than 3 months after bombing that Portland interview, we found ourselves packing up our lives and relocating to Austin, Texas. Here, we knew not a single soul. We sacrificed every saved penny to change the future horizon, for the better. In Austin, I would attend the Makersquare Software Development immersive program, to learn full-stack engineering principles.</p>

			<p>To admit that the transition was hard as hell has to be an understatement, in some regard. Little Pax was still just a baby, Evan was ripped away from all that was familiar, and the weather change took a toll on us from the moment we arrived. Khris and I looked to each other, knowing that all we had were hopes, prayers, and the determination to make things better for our family.</p>

			<p>Fast forward to about a year after we arrived, and our lives have successfully flourished despite the challenges. Khris spends every moment with our boys, homeschooling the two and raising them to be respectful, intelligent, and loving boys. We have a nice and comfortable home that we can call our own. And as for me, I am fortunate to be in a position where I can provide for my wife and kids, in a field that I am loving so far.</p>

			<p>As a family, we are truly blessed. God has been good to us and I am thrilled to see how our lives, as a unit, continues to unfold in the years ahead.</p>

			<p>To be continued...</p>

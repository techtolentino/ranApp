	    <p>The first thing you should know is that I'm truly blessed and lucky to be where I am today. To put it simply - I have a beautiful family that I am completely in love with. I have an amazing career as a Software Product Design Professional at IBM. And, there is a certain type of momentum I see in myself that I have never seen before.</p>
	    <p>The truth be told, it hasn't always been this way. In fact, we once lived in a small, crammed bedroom in a relative's house in San Diego, California. I was working for the YMCA, making about $15 an hour, and expected to support a family of four. It was very different.</p>
	    <p>In December of 2013, I remember failing a Skype interview for an Ed-Tech position in Portland, OR. The interviewer proposed the scenario of a teacher wanting to make the switch from 'using Dreamweaver to writing her own CSS', then asked me what my recommendation would be.</p>
